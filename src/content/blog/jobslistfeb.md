The tech job market is wild right now. And this can result in a lot of well-meaning people feel like they have to take roles that don't match their ethics. I've been collecting and posting tech jobs where jobseekers could have a positive impact (or which at least don't make the world worse, hopefully) on social media for some time now. I'm cross posting these to my blog to have a more cohesive list that's less ephemeral than Mastodon posts.

FAQ:
- What are the critera used to judge if these jobs are "good" or "ethical"?
  - Just my very general impressions! But I love feedback, please let me know if there's orgs I should exclude or include from this list!
- Why are there so many UK jobs?
  - I live here!
