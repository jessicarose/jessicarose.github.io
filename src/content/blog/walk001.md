"I was talking to [Stuart](https://www.kryogenix.org) at the pub" is how a lot of my goofy ideas start, but this time, I was walking with Stuart to a really great [Malaysian restaurant](https://www.tripadvisor.co.uk/Restaurant_Review-g186402-d26192327-Reviews-Cafe_1_Malaysia-Birmingham_West_Midlands_England.html) on a side street and arguing¹ softly about if that side street even existed.


Knowing that I love city walking and Brum in roughly equal amounts, Stuart asked if I think I've walked every street in Birmingham. And what an exciting question. I started looking for a system to track my exploration of the city that didn't use paper and pen map marking. Luckily another friend pointed me to this [blog post by Strava](https://stories.strava.com/articles/how-to-complete-an-every-single-street-challenge-using-strava), which pointed me in turn to this [extremely good webapp](https://wandrer.earth/) that lets you track how much of an area you've walked, with added gamification to keep you exploring.


So I went for a little walk, just to start. Here's what I found.


- A fancy artisan market in a fancy residential part of Edgbaston and met some of the above-pictured team for [Buzzard Valley Wines](https://www.buzzards-valley.co.uk/), who managed to sell me a very heavy bottle of fizz to carry on my travels.
- [The Share Shack](https://theaws.co.uk/active-communities/share-shacks/ladywood-share-shack/): A cool as anything tool library and repair space in Ladywood! It's so nice to see toys, games, tools and a whole heckton of other things local residents can check out being made available. The whole (3 hour) walk was worth it to discover this place. It's going to keep me exploring.


¹ I was right, for the record.
